<h3>Introduction to the Spring Framework<h3>
<h3>Homework №2:</h4>
<h3>🎓 Student Testing Application — Extended Version</h5>

<p>
In this assignment, you will continue developing the student testing application that began in Homework №1. The goal is to enhance the existing console-based solution using Spring Framework features and the updated project template provided to you.</p>

<h3>🧩 Current Task</h2>

<p>
The updated version of the application must request the student’s first and last name, present a series of questions with multiple-choice answers, and output the final test result.</p>

<p>
The work must be done using the provided project template. Some classes in the new template differ from those in Homework №1, so you may need to adapt or migrate classes/files from the previous solution, taking these changes into account.
</p>

<h3>⚙️ Requirements</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Use Java + annotation-based configuration for defining the Spring application context.</li> 
    <li>Resource file name (CSV) and passing score must be configured via the properties file.</li> 
    <li>Adapt/transfer the unit test for the testing service.</li> 
    <li>Write an integration test for the question DAO (integration only with the file system; no Spring context, dependencies mocked where applicable).</li> 
    <li>All tests included in the template must pass.</li>
</ul>
